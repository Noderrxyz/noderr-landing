# Noderr X/Twitter Account - Actual Brand Messaging

**Account:** @NoderrProtocol
**URL:** https://twitter.com/NoderrProtocol

## Official Bio/Slogan

**"Trust-weighted infrastructure. ZK-governed. DAO-controlled. | Coming Soon: The Future of Decentralized Orchestration"**

## Key Messaging Elements

1. **Trust-weighted infrastructure** - This is the primary positioning
2. **ZK-governed** - Zero-knowledge governance is emphasized
3. **DAO-controlled** - Decentralized autonomous organization control
4. **"The Future of Decentralized Orchestration"** - This is the tagline/vision statement

## Current Landing Page Issues

The landing page currently says:
- "Powered by autonomous trading system secured by the DAO"

**This is WRONG.** The X account emphasizes:
- **Trust-weighted infrastructure** (not "autonomous trading system")
- **ZK-governed** (not just "secured by the DAO")
- **Decentralized Orchestration** (not mentioned at all on landing page)

## Recommended Fix

The Hero section and trust indicators should align with the X account messaging:
- "Trust-weighted infrastructure. ZK-governed. DAO-controlled."
- Emphasize "Decentralized Orchestration" as the vision
- The autonomous trading system is a **component**, not the primary identity
